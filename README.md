File Application README

This application will communicate with the TrustedServer. Before this is possible it is necessary to 
start the application once. At this time the two files are generated the sealedkey.txt and the publicID.txt. 

The publicID.txt must be copied to the Trusted Server. 
Furthermore a file called Testfile.txt must be placed in the project folder. This file should contain the input 
data, which will be encrypted and decrypted again. The plain.txt should contain the same content in the end. 
This file is already placed there, but without content. You can modify it and insert the content you like.
